# covid_19_Tracker
This project is a sample project written in angular. Here we are using three sidebar links associated with three modules, and every modules have their path matched full routers that are responsible to show their consecutive component on click. We are using Route instead of Routes array for lazy loading.

#Modules used in the project : 
1) highcharts-angular
2) hicharts
3) bootstrap
4) ng-zorro-antd
5) ngx-formly

1) paste the clone link of this project after goin into the terminal of the desired folder
2) open the project in your any favourite editor
3) write npm install --save if that does not work and your cli pops out error of peer dependencies, write npm install --legacy-peer-deps --save
4) After installing the modules, run the project by typing ng serve in the terminal and you will see the localhost:4200 running your project.
